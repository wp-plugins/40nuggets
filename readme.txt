== What the Others Do ==


Overlay pop-ups are a powerful way to convert more of your traffic into leads. However, most of the popover tools on WordPress are largely one-size fits all, meaning that your messages are only appropriate for a small percentage of your traffic. In many cases these pop-ups serve to annoy your visitors rather than convert them.


== What We Do Better - Customization ==


Nuggets are dynamic pop-ups that improve your visitors’ experience and turn your web traffic into leads. Messages created in 40Nuggets are smart and polite, making it easy for you to engage your customers by creating personalized offers for specific pages, visitor types, and more. The timing of your messages will be adapted to the behavior of each unique visitor, giving you a huge competitive advantage in conversions while preserving your customer’s experience.


We believe that sophisticated web conversion tools should be accessible to all-- not just the largest companies with the biggest budgets. Because of this, Nuggets are:
* Customer Sensitive: Providing a personalized experience and engaging environment for inbound visitors.
* Smart: Sophisticated behavioral and segmentation targeting.
* Efficient: Quick and easy to use, taking less than three minutes to setup.
* Integrated: Nuggets connect to your existing marketing tools.


Nuggets also come with automatically managed A/B testing. A/B testing allows you to design different variants of the same Nugget so you can pinpoint which elements produce the highest conversions. 40Nuggets automatically optimizes the highest converting variant so you can sit back and relax while the plug-in does the heavy lifting for you.


Advanced users can access a complete HTML/CSS/JS 40Nuggets editor, allowing virtually any form of Nugget or adjustment to a website. You can even pass custom data to 40Nuggets.


Nuggets are customizable in any language. Use geo-targeting to create Nuggets for individuals from different countries in the language they read!

<blockquote>"40Nuggets quite simply got us more leads from our traffic without once having to resort to programmers. We could do sophisticated targeting, and make changes on the fly -- their algorithms made it all work. We saved money because we captured numerous sales leads for much less the cost of acquiring them otherwise."

== Powerful Filters--And Zero Hassle to Manage ==


Beyond providing enterprise-level intelligence and testing tools, 40Nuggets gives you a powerful set of filters to hone your messages. 40Nuggets helps you target by:


* Exit-intent (popping-up just before someone leaves the page), 
* User-behavior targeting, 
* Targeting by specific pages on your site, 
* Device-based targeting, 
* Inbound referrer targeting, 
* Geographic targeting, and much more. 


Our interface is intuitive and easy-to-use, so your offers are zero hassle to manage.


== Easy Integration ==
40Nuggets has built-in integration with Mailchimp, and through web hooks (and tools like Zapier) 40Nuggets easily integrates with other email service providers such as Constant Contact. You can also easily export all your data at anytime.


== Smart Targeting ==


The 40Nuggets plug-in learns audience behavior on your site to make sure each inbound visitor is being targeted at the right time with the right Nugget. The result? Higher conversions due to intelligently targeted messages.


== Exit Targeting ==


Exit targeting technology (often called exit-intent) is a valuable tool to boost your conversions, or the conversions of your clients. It works by automatically detecting when a potential lead is about to leave your site and presents a targeted Nugget, giving you another chance to engage. This is similar to offering a better price to a customer as they are about to leave your store, and it is done simply and automatically. 


== Referral Targeting ==


Video overlay windows are here! Want to put a video in one of your overlay calls-to-action? Well, now you can do exactly that. When you create a Nugget, just choose the Embed Code input field, and paste in the embed code from YouTube, Vimeo, or wherever you're hosting your video. 


== Geo Targeting ==


You can target a overlay window in realtime to visitors from specific locations. Messages can be targeted to countries, or specific states within the US. This is useful for a few reasons:


* Targeting by territory: If you’re a seller that is focused on Ohio, for example, you can focus your pop-ups on that population.
* Language: You can use a message to welcome or engage visitors from different countries in their own language. This may significantly increase your conversion rates for those regions.
* Targeted discounts: You can offer shipping discounts to regions where it might make the difference in the buying decision. 
* Targeted Announcements: You can make announcements to people based on region.


== A/B Testing ==


A/B testing allows you to design different variants of the same Nugget so you can pinpoint which elements produce the highest conversions. 40Nuggets automatically optimizes the highest converting variant so you can sit back and relax while the plug-in does the heavy lifting for you. It’s that simple.

== Referral Targeting ==


Do you want to show something only to people inbound from social, paid, or organic sources? Now you can with source targeting. Simply assign an overlay window to a specific inbound referral source, and your message will only show up for those visitors.

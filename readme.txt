**What the Others Do**
Overlay popups are a powerful way to convert more of your traffic into leads. However, most of the popover tools on WordPress are largely one-size fits all, meaning that your popover is only appropriate for a small percentage of your traffic. In many cases these popups serve to annoy your visitors, rather than convert them.

**What We Do Better - Customization**
40Nuggets is different. It provides you advanced segmentation tools, so you can customize messages to specific pages, specific visitor types, and more. Moreover, it puts algorithmic intelligence at your fingertips: your popup's timing will be adapted to the behavior of each and every user, giving you a huge competitive-advantage in conversions, while preserving the customer experience of your site. Moreover, Nuggets come with A/B testing--the test is managed automatically--so that you are always improving. Nuggets come in different shapes with ready made customizable themes. 
Advanced users can access a complete HTML/CSS/JS 40Nuggets editor, allowing virtually any form of nugget or adjustment to a website - you can even pass custom data to 40Nuggets.
Nuggets are customizable in any language - use geo targeting to create Nuggets for individuals from different countries in the language they read!

Watch a quick video tutorial of how to setup a Nugget:

== Smart Targeting ==

40Nuggets plugin can learn audience behavior on your site so as to make sure each inbound visitor is being targeted at the right time with the nugget that they're most likely to convert on. 

== Exit Targeting ==

If you are an online marketing professional, exit targeting technology (often called exit-intent is a valuable tool to boost your conversions, or the conversions of your clients who pay you to increase their conversion rates. It works by automatically detecting when a potential lead is about to leave your site and pops up a targeted call-to-action in front of them, and may get them to stay on your site, giving you another chance to engage, which may or may not include a sale.

This is similar in the real world to offering a better price to someone as they are about to leave your store. And it is all done simply and automatically using this great, new exit targeting technology.

== Referral Targeting ==

Video overlay windows are here! Want to put a video in one of your overlay calls-to-action? Well, now you can do exactly that. When you create a call to action just choose the Embed Code input field, and paste in the embed code from YouTube, Vimeo, or wherever you're hosting your video.

== Geo Targeting ==

You can target a overlay window, in realtime, to visitors from specific countries and in the US, states as well.

Why is this useful?

Here are a few ways:

* Targeting by territory: If you?re a seller that is focused on Ohio, for example, you can now be sure that your popups are focused on approximately that population.
* Language: You can use a popup to welcome or engage visitors from different countries in their own language. This may significantly increase your conversion rates for those regions.
* Targeted discounts: You can offer shipping discounts to regions where it might make the difference in the buying decision.
* Targeted Announcements: You can make announcements to people based on region.

== A/B Testing ==

A/B testing allows you to design different variants of the same call-to-action so you can pinpoint exactly what elements produce the highest conversions.  It's a sophisticated combination of design control for your marketing team, paired with the automated intelligence of 40Nuggets. Our brain automatically optimizes the highest converting variant, presenting it more often, so you can sit back and relax as 40Nuggets does the heavy lifting for you. It's that simple.

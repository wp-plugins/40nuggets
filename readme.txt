Improve your Wordpress conversion rates by using intelligent overlay windows and smart targeting technology.

== Description ==

Your website's hard-won traffic should be converting: joining your mailing list, talking to sales, engaging your social, and achieving other goals you set.  Overlay windows and popups or popovers are a powerful way to turn more of your traffic into leads. However, most of the popover tools on Wordpress are largely one-size fits all, meaning that your popover is only appropriate for a small percentage of your traffic. 40Nuggets is intelligent in that it adapts your overlays window's timing to the behavior of each and every user, giving you a huge competitive-advantage. Beyond that, 40Nuggets allows you to target by exit-intent, user-behavior, inbound referrer, geography, and much more. It's zero hassle to manage.

40Nuggets uses a unique mix of easy to deploy overlay windows, with the smartest machine learning technology, all aimed at bringing you a massive lift in your conversion rates. 

This is not only for growing your email list - you can use it for many goals, and to target inbound visitors in many ways, including from a specific ad or traffic source, a geographic region, and more. You can

== Smart Targeting ==

40Nuggets plugin can track audience behavior on your site so as to make sure each inbound visitor is being targeted at the right time with the overlay that they're most likely to convert on. 

== Exit Targeting ==

If you are an online marketing professional, exit targeting technology (often called exit-intent is a valuable tool to boost your conversions, or the conversions of your clients who pay you to increase their conversion rates. It works by automatically detecting when a potential lead is about to leave your site and pops up a Òtargeted call-to-actionÓ in front of them, and may get them to stay on your site, giving you another chance to engage, which may or may not include a sale.

This is similar in the real world to offering a better price to someone as they are about to leave your store. And it is all done simply and automatically using this great, new exit targeting technology.

== Referral Targeting ==

Video overlay windows are here! Want to put a video in one of your overlay calls-to-action? Well, now you can do exactly that. When you create a call to action just choose the "Embed Code" input field, and paste in the embed code from YouTube, Vimeo, or anywhere else.

== Geo Targeting ==

You can target a overlay window, in realtime, to visitors from specific countries and in the US, states as well.

Why is this useful?

Here are a few ways:

* Targeting by territory: If youÕre a seller that is focused on Ohio, for example, you can now be sure that your CTAÕs are focused on approximately that population.
* Language: You can use a CTA to welcome or engage visitors from different countries in their own language. This may significantly increase your conversion rates for those regions.
* Targeted discounts: You can offer shipping discounts to regions where it might make the difference in the buying decision.
* Targeted Announcements: You can make announcements to people based on region.

== A/B Testing ==

A/B testing allows you to design different variants of the same call-to-action so you can pinpoint exactly what elements produce the highest conversions.  It's a sophisticated combination of design control for your marketing team, paired with the automated intelligence of 40Nuggets. Our brain automatically optimizes the highest converting variant, presenting it more often, so you can sit back and relax as 40Nuggets does the heavy lifting for you. It's that simple.
